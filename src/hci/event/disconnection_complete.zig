/// disconnection was successful. If the disconnection was not successful, the
/// value of the reason parameter shall be ignored by the Host. For example, this
/// can be the case if the Host has issued the HCI_Disconnect command and there
/// was a parameter error, or the command was not presently allowed, or a
/// Connection_Handle that didnâ€™t correspond to a connection was given.

/// Note: When a physical link fails, one HCI_Disconnection_Complete event will be
/// returned for each logical channel on the physical link with the corresponding
/// Connection_Handle as a parameter.
